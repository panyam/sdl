# SDL Project: Conference Workshop Roadmap

**Primary Focus:** "Building an Open Source System Design Interview Coach With Interactive Simulations"

This document outlines the workshop-focused development roadmap for delivering a compelling conference presentation that demonstrates SDL as the ultimate system design interview preparation platform.

---
## Completed

*   **`[COMPLETED]` Interactive Session Engine (`console.Canvas`):**
    *   The `console.Canvas` API is now a stable and robust engine for interactive analysis.
    *   Core workflow (`Load`, `Use`, `Set`, `Run`, `Plot`) is fully functional and tested.
    *   The `Set` command is particularly powerful, supporting runtime modification of parameters on both top-level instances and their nested dependencies (e.g., `app.cache.HitRate`).
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Loader & Runtime Enhancements:**
    *   The `loader` now correctly handles imports of all declaration types, including `native method`.
    *   The `runtime` can now instantiate all available native components from the `components` library.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Native Methods & Grammar Simplification:**
    *   Added support for top-level `native method` declarations.
    *   Refactored the `delay` statement into a standard native method call, simplifying the grammar.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Plotting & Visualization:**
    *   The `sdl plot` command supports latency, count, and histogram plots.
    *   The `sdl diagram` command supports static (architecture) and dynamic (sequence) diagrams.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Capacity Modeling:**
    *   The `ResourcePool` component now supports full M/M/c queuing calculations.
    *   Canvas API correctly handles capacity modeling workflows with proper instance management.
    *   Boolean evaluation enhanced to handle `Outcomes[Bool]` types with embedded latency.
    *   Duration parsing fixed to use correct unit conversion (seconds as base unit).
    *   All Canvas tests pass, demonstrating realistic queuing delays under different loads.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Netflix Workshop Demo:**
    *   Comprehensive Netflix streaming service model with CDN, database, encoding, and load balancing components.
    *   Complete traffic spike scenario demonstrating 4x load increase and performance impact.
    *   Canvas-based test suite validating all workshop demonstration flows.
    *   Edge case testing for live Q&A scenarios and rapid parameter modification.
    *   Ready-to-demo example showcasing system design interview coaching concepts.

## ðŸŽ¯ CONFERENCE WORKSHOP PRIORITIES

### ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL PATH (Essential for Conference Success)

## 1. Validate Netflix Demo Foundation

*   **Test Current Capabilities:**
    *   Run `examples/netflix/traffic_spike_demo_test.go` to validate existing Canvas API
    *   Identify and fix any gaps in parameter modification or simulation execution
    *   Ensure reliable performance for live demonstration scenarios

## 2. Implement Workshop Presentation Tools

*   **Create the `sdl execute` command:**
    *   Build `cmd/sdl/commands/execute.go` for recipe-based demos
    *   Enable scripted scenario progression during presentations
    *   Support live parameter modification with immediate visual feedback
*   **Build the `sdl dashboard` command:**
    *   Multi-panel real-time visualization interface
    *   Show latency plots, architecture diagrams, and system metrics simultaneously
    *   Update visualizations as parameters change during live demos

## 3. Polish Workshop Experience

*   **Create workshop-specific scenarios:**
    *   Additional FAANG interview examples (Uber dispatch, Instagram feed, WhatsApp messaging)
    *   Edge case demonstrations for audience Q&A
    *   Rapid iteration examples showing parameter sensitivity

### ðŸ”§ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Post-Conference)

## 4. Enhanced Component Library

*   **Add More Realistic Components:**
    *   CDN with geographic distribution modeling
    *   Message queues with different consistency models
    *   Microservice communication patterns
    *   Auto-scaling and load balancing primitives

## 5. Advanced Workshop Features

*   **Automated Scenario Progression:**
    *   Guided workshop steps with hints and explanations
    *   Interactive tutorials for common system design patterns
    *   Integration with presentation tools for seamless demos

## 6. Future Platform Development

*   **Web-Based "Incredible Machine" Interface:**
    *   Drag-and-drop system component composition
    *   Real-time parameter sliders and live visualization updates
    *   Collaborative system design sessions
*   **Full Concurrency Model Implementation:**
    *   Complete `gobatch N { ... }` parallel execution modeling
    *   Advanced aggregator methods (`WaitAll`, `WaitAny`, `Quorum`)
