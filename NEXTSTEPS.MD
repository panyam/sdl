## Completed

*   **`[COMPLETED]` ðŸŽ‰ WEB CANVAS VISUALIZATION DASHBOARD - SIMPLE 2-ROW LAYOUT:**
    *   Complete TypeScript + Tailwind frontend with simple 2-row dynamic "Incredible Machine" layout
    *   **Enhanced System Architecture**: 70% width prominent panel with detailed component visualization and system health dashboard
    *   **Separated Control Panels**: Traffic Generation (top-right) and System Parameters (bottom-right) for organized workflow
    *   **Unlimited Scrollable Metrics**: Dynamic grid supporting infinite chart addition via `canvas.Measure()` calls
    *   **Proper Panel Clipping**: All content properly contained within panel boundaries with overflow:hidden
    *   **Color-Coded Charts**: Red (latency), Green (QPS), Orange (errors), Purple (cache), Blue (utilization), Pink (memory)
    *   Real-time parameter controls with instant visual feedback across multiple metrics
    *   Chart.js integration for live performance visualization with responsive grid layout
    *   WebSocket communication for real-time updates across all connected dashboards
    *   HTTP API backend with Canvas operations (load, use, set, run, plot)
    *   Production-ready web stack with single-command deployment: `./sdl serve --port 8080`
    *   Comprehensive testing suite including Playwright automation for layout validation
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Canvas API Foundation:**
    *   The `console.Canvas` API is now a stable and robust engine powering both CLI and web interfaces.
    *   Core workflow (`Load`, `Use`, `Set`, `Run`, `Plot`) is fully functional and tested across multiple interfaces.
    *   The `Set` command supports runtime modification of parameters on both top-level instances and their nested dependencies (e.g., `app.cache.HitRate`).
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Contacts Service Validation:**
    *   Simple 2-tier phone lookup service (`examples/contacts/`) created for Canvas API validation
    *   Complete test suite covering parameter modification, visualization, and rapid iteration scenarios
    *   Serves as clean foundation for workshop demonstrations and web dashboard development
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Shared Type System:**
    *   Created `types/` package for shared data structures between backend and frontend
    *   Type-safe communication across the entire web stack
    *   Eliminated import cycles and improved code organization
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Loader & Runtime Enhancements:**
    *   The `loader` now correctly handles imports of all declaration types, including `native method`.
    *   The `runtime` can now instantiate all available native components from the `components` library.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Native Methods & Grammar Simplification:**
    *   Added support for top-level `native method` declarations.
    *   Refactored the `delay` statement into a standard native method call, simplifying the grammar.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Plotting & Visualization:**
    *   The `sdl plot` command supports latency, count, and histogram plots.
    *   The `sdl diagram` command supports static (architecture) and dynamic (sequence) diagrams.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Capacity Modeling:**
    *   The `ResourcePool` component now supports full M/M/c queuing calculations.
    *   Canvas API correctly handles capacity modeling workflows with proper instance management.
    *   Boolean evaluation enhanced to handle `Outcomes[Bool]` types with embedded latency.
    *   Duration parsing fixed to use correct unit conversion (seconds as base unit).
    *   All Canvas tests pass, demonstrating realistic queuing delays under different loads.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Netflix Workshop Demo:**
    *   Comprehensive Netflix streaming service model with CDN, database, encoding, and load balancing components.
    *   Complete traffic spike scenario demonstrating 4x load increase and performance impact.
    *   Canvas-based test suite validating all workshop demonstration flows.
    *   Edge case testing for live Q&A scenarios and rapid parameter modification.
    *   Ready-to-demo example showcasing system design interview coaching concepts.
