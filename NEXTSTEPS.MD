## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (December 2025)

### **Live Metrics System - Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ**
The runtime metrics infrastructure is now complete and ready for console integration:

1. **‚úÖ Core Runtime Metrics** 
   - Virtual time support using `core.Duration` for deterministic simulation
   - Component instance resolution by name (e.g., "server" not "ContactAppServer")
   - Efficient event matching with direct pointer comparison
   - CircularBuffer for memory-efficient data storage
   - Comprehensive aggregation functions (sum, rate, percentiles)
   - Full integration with SimpleEval through ExecutionTracer

2. **‚úÖ Key Design Decisions**
   - Metrics owned by runtime, not console (for testability)
   - System-aware MetricStore resolves component names from environment
   - TraceEvent simplified to carry Component/Method references directly
   - Tests use real SDL systems instead of mocks

3. **Next: Console API Layer**
   - Create REST endpoints for measurement CRUD operations
   - Add data retrieval endpoints with aggregation support
   - Wire into existing Canvas web infrastructure
   - Update dashboard to display live metrics

### **Flow Analysis API Implementation**
1. **Abstract Flow API** 
   - Create `/api/flows/{strategy}/eval` endpoint for strategy-agnostic flow evaluation
   - Implement flow strategy registry with pluggable implementations
   - Return consistent FlowEdge and rate information regardless of strategy
   - Support for listing available strategies and their capabilities

2. **CLI Flow Commands**
   - `sdl flows list` - Show available flow evaluation strategies
   - `sdl flows eval --strategy=runtime` - Evaluate flows with specific strategy
   - `sdl flows apply <strategy>` - Apply calculated rates as arrival rates
   - `sdl flows show` - Display current arrival rates and source strategy

3. **Manual Rate Override**
   - API endpoint for setting component method arrival rates
   - CLI command: `sdl component <comp>.<method> set-arrival-rate <rate>`
   - Track manual overrides separately from calculated rates
   - Show warnings when manual rates differ significantly from calculated

### **FlowEval Strategy Development**
1. **Document Current Limitations**
   - ‚úÖ Early return control flow causes overestimation
   - ‚úÖ No capacity-based backpressure modeling yet
   - ‚úÖ Suitable for initial sizing (conservative overestimation)
   
2. **Future Strategy Types**
   - Monte Carlo simulation-based (run SimpleEval multiple times)
   - Feedback-based (observe actual flows during runs)
   - Control-flow aware (handle early returns properly)
   - Capacity-aware (use delays for backpressure)

### **Technical Foundation**
- Keep FlowEval and SimpleEval separate (different evaluation semantics)
- Use current runtime-based FlowEval as default strategy
- Allow users to manually adjust rates where needed
- Focus on making flow analysis a helper tool, not a critical dependency
