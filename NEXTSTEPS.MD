    *   The `loader` now correctly handles imports of all declaration types, including `native method`.
    *   The `runtime` can now instantiate all available native components from the `components` library.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Native Methods & Grammar Simplification:**
    *   Added support for top-level `native method` declarations.
    *   Refactored the `delay` statement into a standard native method call, simplifying the grammar.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Plotting & Visualization:**
    *   The `sdl plot` command supports latency, count, and histogram plots.
    *   The `sdl diagram` command supports static (architecture) and dynamic (sequence) diagrams.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Capacity Modeling:**
    *   The `ResourcePool` component now supports full M/M/c queuing calculations.
    *   Canvas API correctly handles capacity modeling workflows with proper instance management.
    *   Boolean evaluation enhanced to handle `Outcomes[Bool]` types with embedded latency.
    *   Duration parsing fixed to use correct unit conversion (seconds as base unit).
    *   All Canvas tests pass, demonstrating realistic queuing delays under different loads.
*   **`[COMPLETED]` Netflix Workshop Demo:**
    *   Comprehensive Netflix streaming service model with CDN, database, encoding, and load balancing components.
    *   Complete traffic spike scenario demonstrating 4x load increase and performance impact.
    *   Canvas-based test suite validating all workshop demonstration flows.
    *   Edge case testing for live Q&A scenarios and rapid parameter modification.
    *   Ready-to-demo example showcasing system design interview coaching concepts.
