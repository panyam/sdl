# SDL Project Summary

## Method-Level System Diagram Implementation (June 23, 2025)

### Overview
Successfully implemented method-to-method visualization in system diagrams, providing detailed insight into actual component interaction patterns at the method call level.

### Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. NeighborsFromMethod Integration
- **Problem**: Previous diagram implementation used custom AST traversal that was incomplete and error-prone
- **Solution**: Leveraged existing `ComponentInstance.NeighborsFromMethod()` that properly traverses SDL method bodies to find all component method calls
- **Result**: Accurate method call discovery with proper handling of conditional statements, nested calls, and complex expressions

#### 2. Method-Level Node Representation  
- **Format**: Nodes use "component:method" naming (e.g., `webserver:RequestRide`, `database:FindNearestDriver`)
- **Traffic Display**: Each method node shows arrival rates from flow analysis (e.g., "5.0 rps")
- **Internal Visibility**: Now includes internal component methods like `database.pool:Acquire` and `database.driverTable:Scan`

#### 3. Runtime Instance-Based Architecture
- **Foundation**: Diagram generation uses actual `ComponentInstance` objects from the runtime system
- **Shared Instance Handling**: Properly handles component sharing where the same instance is referenced by multiple paths
- **Two-Pass Discovery**: Uses breadth-first traversal to build instance-to-path mapping with orphaned node detection

#### 4. AST-Based Edge Extraction
- **ComponentInstance.NeighborsFromMethod()**: Analyzes SDL method body AST to find all call expressions
- **Environment Resolution**: Resolves component references through the runtime environment chain
- **Edge Creation**: Creates precise method-to-method edges based on actual call patterns

### Implementation Details

#### Key Code Changes
- **`console/canvas.go`**: Completely rewrote `GetSystemDiagram()` to use `NeighborsFromMethod()`
- **`runtime/component.go`**: Enhanced `NeighborsFromMethod()` with nil safety checks
- **`web/src/dashboard.ts`**: UI improvements - removed redundant spinner controls, disabled auto-polling

#### Nil Safety Fix
- **Issue**: `NeighborsFromMethod()` could crash on nil `methodDecl.Body`
- **Fix**: Added proper null checks before AST traversal
- **Result**: Robust handling of methods without implementation bodies

#### UI Polish
- **Generator Controls**: Removed redundant up/down spinner buttons, kept clean +/- button interface
- **Polling Strategy**: Disabled automatic ListGenerators polling, added manual refresh button
- **Visual Consistency**: Method nodes display traffic rates consistently across the interface

### Example Output
The Uber MVP system now shows detailed method-level flows:
```
webserver:RequestRide (5.0 rps)
├── database:FindNearestDriver
│   ├── database.pool:Acquire (9.9 rps)  
│   └── database.driverTable:Scan (4.9 rps)
├── mapsService:CalculateRoute (5.0 rps)
│   └── mapsService.pool:Acquire (4.9 rps)
└── database:CreateRide (5.0 rps)
    └── database.pool:Acquire (already shown)
```

### Technical Learnings

#### 1. AST Traversal Patterns
- SDL method bodies require recursive traversal of statement types
- Environment-based component resolution is more reliable than string matching
- Null safety is critical when dealing with optional method implementations

#### 2. Runtime vs Static Analysis
- Runtime ComponentInstance objects provide the ground truth for shared instances
- Static declaration analysis can miss runtime sharing patterns
- Flow analysis rates need runtime context to be accurate

#### 3. Visualization Design Patterns  
- Colon separator (`:`) clearly distinguishes method nodes from component paths
- Traffic rate display provides immediate insight into system load distribution
- Internal component visibility reveals hidden bottlenecks and dependencies

### Performance Impact
- **Memory**: Efficient instance path mapping with O(n) traversal
- **CPU**: AST analysis is fast as it reuses existing runtime structures  
- **Network**: No additional API calls needed, uses existing flow analysis data

### Future Enhancements
- **Conditional Edge Labels**: Show when edges are taken (e.g., "on cache miss")
- **Execution Order**: Number edges to show call sequence within methods
- **Success Rate Display**: Show method success rates on edges for reliability analysis

### Testing Results
- **Nil Safety**: Handles components without method implementations gracefully
- **Complex Systems**: Successfully visualizes Uber MVP with nested components and resource pools
- **UI Responsiveness**: Dashboard updates smoothly with new method-level diagrams
- **Flow Integration**: Arrival rates from flow analysis display correctly on method nodes

This implementation provides the foundation for advanced system visualization and debugging capabilities in SDL.
