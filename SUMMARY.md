Okay, I have processed the final set of files and incorporated the recent changes, especially the introduction of the `ContentService` and the refactoring of content loading/saving responsibilities.

Here is a detailed summary of the LeetCoach system in its current state:

**LeetCoach System Summary (Post-Refactor)**

**1. Overview:**

*   **Purpose:** LeetCoach is a web application aimed at facilitating system design interview preparation.
*   **Core Feature:** Allows users to create, view, and edit multi-section "Design" documents.
*   **Section Types:** Supports distinct section types within a Design:
    *   **Text:** Rich text editing powered by TinyMCE.
    *   **Drawing:** Diagramming using the Excalidraw library (integrated via React).
    *   **Plot:** Placeholder for future charting/visualization integration.
*   **Authentication:** Provides user login via local email/password and OAuth providers (Google, GitHub).

**2. Architecture & Technologies:**

*   **Backend (Go):**
    *   Utilizes **gRPC** for service definitions (`DesignService`, `TagService`, `ContentService`, potential `AdminService`).
    *   **`DesignService`:** Manages Design metadata and the *structure* of sections (IDs, order, titles). Uses a **filesystem persistence strategy** (`<basePath>/<designId>/design.json`). Handles CRUD for designs and Add/Delete/Move/Title updates for sections. Relies on `ContentService` for actual section content. Concurrency managed via per-design mutexes.
    *   **`ContentService`:** **New!** Manages the storage and retrieval of the *actual content* for each section. Uses the filesystem (`<basePath>/<designId>/sections/<sectionId>/content.<name>`), storing content as raw bytes (often base64 encoded in transit). Handles different named content pieces per section (e.g., `main`, `light.svg`, `dark.svg`). Works closely with `DesignService`.
    *   **`TagService` & Authentication:** Appear configured to use **Google Cloud Datastore** via `services.ClientMgr`.
    *   **Converters (`services/converters.go`):** Helper functions to map between Go service structs and gRPC Protobuf messages.
*   **Web Layer (Go):**
    *   Standard `net/http` server (`web/server.go`).
    *   **gRPC Gateway:** Exposes backend gRPC services as a RESTful JSON API under `/api/v1/` (`web/api.go`). Handles marshalling between JSON and Protobuf. Registered endpoints now include `ContentService`.
    *   **Authentication (`oneauth` + `scs`):** Located in `web/app.go`, `web/user.go`. Manages OAuth (Google/GitHub) and local login flows. Uses `scs` for session management. Crucially, `web/api.go` injects the authenticated `LoggedInUserId` into outgoing gRPC metadata, making it available to backend services.
    *   **Server-Side Rendering (Go Templates):** `web/views/` uses Go's `html/template` engine (managed by `tmplr` via `web/views/main.go`) to render initial HTML pages (e.g., `HomePage.html`, `DesignEditorPage.html`, `LoginPage.html`). Passes necessary initial data like `DesignId` to the frontend via hidden inputs or embedded data.
    *   **HTMX:** Used on the Design List page (`/`, rendered by `web/views/templates/DesignList.html`) to handle dynamic sorting, searching, and deletion directly within the table via partial updates.
*   **Frontend (TypeScript / React):**
    *   Located primarily in `web/views/components/`.
    *   Architecture: Mostly **Vanilla TypeScript** with a component-based structure. **React/ReactDOM** is specifically used to render the `@excalidraw/excalidraw` component via `ExcalidrawWrapper.tsx` within the `DrawingSection.tsx` component.
    *   **Core Components:**
        *   `DesignEditorPage.ts`: Main orchestrator for the design editing view (`/designs/{id}/edit`).
        *   `SectionManager.ts`: Manages the overall list of sections (adding, deleting, moving, reordering) and updates the `TableOfContents`. It *no longer* handles section content loading/saving directly.
        *   `BaseSection.ts`: Abstract base class for all section types. Handles common UI (header, controls), view/edit mode switching (using `TemplateLoader.ts`), title editing, and **now initiates the loading of its own content** via `loadContent()` and provides hooks for saving content.
        *   `TextSection.ts`, `DrawingSection.tsx`, `PlotSection.ts`: Concrete implementations extending `BaseSection`, providing type-specific editors (TinyMCE, Excalidraw) and view rendering logic. They implement content fetching/saving logic via `refreshContentFromServer` and `handleSaveClick`.
        *   `DocumentTitle.ts`: Handles display and editing of the main Design title.
        *   `TableOfContents.ts`: Renders the sidebar TOC and handles navigation/mobile interactions.
        *   `Modal.ts`, `ToastManager.ts`, `ThemeManager.ts`: UI utility components.
        *   `TemplateLoader.ts`: Helper class to load client-side templates from `TemplateRegistry.html`.
    *   **API Client (`apiclient/`, `Api.ts`):** Auto-generated TypeScript client via OpenAPI spec from gRPC Gateway. Interacts with the `/api/v1/` REST endpoints. `Api.ts` configures the base path and uses a `fetchApi` interceptor to dynamically add the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header by reading the `LeetCoachAuthToken` cookie. Includes clients for `DesignServiceApi`, `ContentServiceApi`, and `TagServiceApi`.
    *   **Client-Side Templates (`TemplateRegistry.html`):** Contains reusable HTML snippets (modals, section view/edit modes) cloned by `TemplateLoader` for use by components.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.

**3. Key Data Flows (Post-Refactor):**

*   **Loading a Design (`/designs/{id}/edit`):**
    1.  Go backend renders `DesignEditorPage.html`, embedding the `DesignId`.
    2.  `DesignEditorPage.ts` initializes.
    3.  Calls `DesignApi.designServiceGetDesign({ id: designId, includeSectionMetadata: true })`.
    4.  Updates `DocumentTitle` with the design name.
    5.  Extracts section metadata (`id`, `type`, `title`, `order`) from the response.
    6.  Calls `sectionManager.initializeSections(sectionsMetadata)` to create `BaseSection` instances and render their basic DOM structure (including the correct view template shell).
    7.  `DesignEditorPage` iterates through the created `BaseSection` instances.
    8.  For each section instance, `DesignEditorPage` calls `section.loadContent()`.
    9.  Each `BaseSection` instance (`loadContent` calls `refreshContentFromServer`):
        *   Displays an internal "Loading..." state.
        *   Calls `ContentApi.contentServiceGetContent({ designId, sectionId, name: "main" })` (and potentially others like `light.svg`).
        *   On success, decodes the content (`atob`) and calls its `populateViewContent()` method to render the actual content within its view template.
        *   On error, displays an error message within its view template.
*   **Saving Changes (Incremental):**
    *   **Design Title:** `DocumentTitle.ts` -> `DesignApi.designServiceUpdateDesign({ designId, body: { design: { name }, updateMask: "name" }})`.
    *   **Section Title:** `BaseSection.ts` (title edit handler) -> `callbacks.onTitleChange` -> `SectionManager.updateSectionTitle` -> `DesignApi.designServiceUpdateSection({ sectionDesignId, sectionId, body: { section: { title }, updateMask: "title" }})`.
    *   **Section Content:**
        *   User finishes editing (e.g., clicks "Save" in section's edit mode).
        *   The specific section component (`TextSection`, `DrawingSection`) calls its `handleSaveClick` method.
        *   It gets the content from its editor (`getContentFromEditMode`).
        *   It calls `ContentApi.contentServiceSetContent({ designId, sectionId, name: "main", contentBytes: btoa(...) })`.
        *   `DrawingSection` also generates and saves SVG previews (`light.svg`, `dark.svg`) via `ContentApi.contentServiceSetContent`.
        *   After successful save, the section calls `switchToViewMode(true)` to update its display.
*   **Add/Delete/Move Sections:** Handled by `SectionManager` interacting with `DesignService`'s `AddSection`, `DeleteSection`, and `MoveSection` methods, updating the `design.json` (section ID list) and creating/deleting the section's folder/metadata file (`main.json`). Newly added sections have their initial content rendered via `setInitialContentAndRender`.

**4. Current State:**

*   Backend services (`DesignService`, `ContentService`, `TagService`) are implemented. Persistence uses filesystem for designs/content and Datastore for tags/auth.
*   Frontend `DesignEditorPage` loads designs and sections correctly, with content fetching now delegated to individual `BaseSection` components via the `ContentService`.
*   Incremental saving works for Design Title and Section Title (via `DesignService`). Content saving works via `ContentService`, triggered by `BaseSection` subclasses.
*   Excalidraw integration (`DrawingSection`) allows editing, saving content, and saving SVG previews.
*   Authentication (local/OAuth) and session management are functional.
*   UI components (TOC, Modals, Toasts, Theme Toggle, HTMX-powered list) are operational.
*   Content loading/saving responsibility has been successfully refactored from `SectionManager` to `BaseSection` and its subclasses, interacting with the new `ContentService`.

**5. Known WIP / Next Steps:**

* **Plot Sections:** Requires frontend editor integration (e.g., using a charting library) and potentially backend logic if server-side rendering is needed.
* **Error Handling:** Enhance user feedback (e.g., spinners during section loads, more specific error toasts).
* **Full Save/Export Buttons:** Implement functionality for the header buttons (currently placeholders).
* **Persistence Strategy:** Review the mixed filesystem/Datastore approach for consistency and scalability. Consider migrating design/section metadata to Datastore as well.
* **Testing:** Expand backend tests; implement frontend testing strategy.
* **Tagging:** Implement UI for adding/viewing tags on designs and connect it to the `TagService`.
* **Collaboration Features:** (Longer term) Investigate real-time collaboration aspects.
* **LLM** - LLM Assistance for verifying and providing answers.
