Use this prompt after a working session to generate a snapshot of all the work done so far so it can be continued by
starting fresh:

```
Ok this worked great.  Now let us fully understand this and create a summary of the project.   If you can try to organize the summary on a per folder basis so there is more context for other developers picking this up.   Also generate a great prompt for another LLM to continue working on this using your summary.
```

Save the output into SUMMARY.md at the root.  It will also include a "next prompt" for the next feature you might want
to build.
