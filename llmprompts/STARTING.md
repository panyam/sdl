Assuming you are ready to start from a previous checkpoint and the summary is in SUMMARY.md, Run:

```bash
sh mkprompt.sh | pbcopy
```

This will copy all files into the context.   Then use the following prompt:

```
These are the various files, configs, instructions in my project.  Understand this well.  And when you are ready we will build features that touch one or more parts of this project.
```

And off you go
