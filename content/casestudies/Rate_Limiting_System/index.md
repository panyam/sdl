# Design A Rate Limiting System

A rate-limiting system is designed to protect APIs from abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain system stability. Keeping our focus strictly on rate limiting, the functional requirements should be specific to API protection and avoid broader concerns such as authentication, authorization, or request routing.

### Functional Requirements (~2-3 minutes)

#### **1\. Define & Enforce Rate Limits**

* **Per User/IP Limits**: Restrict API calls based on individual users, IP addresses, or API keys.  
* **Global vs. Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Apply different rate limits per API or across all APIs.  
* **Sliding Window vs. Fixed Window**: Support **rolling time windows** (e.g., 100 requests per 10 seconds) vs. **fixed intervals** (e.g., 100 requests from 12:00 to 12:10).  
* **Burst Handling**: Allow short bursts of requests but throttle sustained high traffic.

#### **2\. Configurable Rate Limits**

* **Per Customer Tiers**: Different rate limits for free, premium, or enterprise users.  
* **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamically adjust limits based on system load (e.g., tighten limits during high traffic).  
* **Custom Rate Limits**: Allow API owners to define their own rate limits.

#### **3\. Distributed Enforcement**

* **Multi-Region Support**: Enforce rate limits consistently across distributed API gateways.  
* **Low-Latency Decisioning**: Ensure rate-limiting checks are **fast** (sub-millisecond response) to avoid adding latency to API requests.  
* **Fault-Tolerant Enforcement**: Continue functioning even if a single rate-limiting node fails.

#### **4\. Real-Time Feedback to Clients**

* **Headers for Rate Limit Status**: Provide `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, and `X-RateLimit-Limit` headers.  
* **Clear HTTP 429 Response**: Return `429 Too Many Requests` with a retry-after time.  
* **Soft Limits & Warnings**: Send warning headers before hitting hard limits.

#### **5\. Logging, Monitoring, and Analytics**

* **Audit Logs**: Track API request counts per user/IP for security audits.  
* **Real-Time Metrics**: Provide dashboards with live rate-limit usage (e.g., Grafana/Prometheus).  
* **Anomaly Detection**: Detect and block unusual API usage patterns (e.g., a single IP spamming multiple endpoints).

#### **6\. Distributed Rate Limiting Enforcement**

* **Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket Implementation**: Control request flow efficiently.  
* **Consistency Across API Gateways**: Ensure rate limits are enforced globally, even in multi-region deployments.

#### **7\. Graceful Handling & Failover**

* **Grace Periods & Exemptions**: Allow emergency overrides for critical requests.  
* **Fail-Safe Mechanism**: Avoid blocking all traffic if the rate limiter fails.

### **Out of Scope (Better Suited to Other Designs)**

| Requirement | More Suitable Design Problem |
| ----- | ----- |
| **API Authentication & Authorization** | API Gateway or Authentication System |
| **DDoS Protection** | Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Bot Detection |
| **Abuse Detection (e.g., fraud, malicious traffic)** | Security & Threat Detection System |
| **Real-Time Request Routing (e.g., Load Balancing)** | API Gateway Load Balancing |
| **ML-Based Request Classification** | API Threat Intelligence System |
