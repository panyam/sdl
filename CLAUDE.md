## Understand the Project First
- Read and learn all about this project by looking at all the SUMMARY.md and ROADMAP.md.  

## WASM Build Memory
- You can build the wasm binary by simply doing `make wasmbin` in the top level directory
## Summary instructions

- When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes

- For the ROADMAP.md always use the top-level ./ROADMAP.md so we have a global view of the roadmap instead of being fragemented in various folders.

## SDL Demo Guidelines
- Make sure when you create SDL demos they are not as markdown but as .recipe files that are executable with pause points that print out what is going to be come next before the SDL command is executed.

## Session Workflow Memories
- When you checkpoint update all relevant .md files with our latest understanding, statuses and progress in the current session and then commit.
