Read and learn all about this project by looking at all the SUMMARY.md and NEXTSTEPS.md.  

I am continuing with a previous project.  You will find the summaries in SUMMARY.md files located in the top level as various sub folders.  NEXTSTEPS.md is used to note what has been completed and what are next steps in our roadmap.
Thorougly understand it and give me a recap so we can continue where we left off.

## Major Architecture Update (June 2025)
The project has undergone significant architectural changes:

### 1. gRPC Migration
- **API Layer**: Migrated from REST to gRPC with HTTP gateway (grpc-gateway)
- **Proto definitions**: `protos/sdl/v1/canvas.proto` and `models.proto`
- **Dual protocol**: gRPC on :9090, REST gateway on :8080
- **Generated code**: Auto-generated in `./gen/` folder

### 2. New Metrics Architecture
- **Tracer Interface**: Clean 4-method interface in runtime for pluggable tracing
- **MetricTracer**: Implementation in console package, processes Exit events only
- **System-specific**: New MetricTracer created on each Canvas.Use() call
- **Channel-based**: Asynchronous event processing with thread-safety
- **Proto embedding**: MetricSpec embeds proto definition directly
- **Documentation**: See `console/NEWMETRICS.md` for details

### 3. Console Package Restructuring
- **service.go**: gRPC CanvasService implementation
- **grpcserver.go/webserver.go**: Server setup and management
- **canvasinfo.go**: Canvas domain logic with thread-safe storage
- **metrictracer.go**: Tracer interface implementation
- **generator.go**: Generator management with flow integration

### 4. CLI Migration
- **All commands use gRPC**: Direct client usage, no more REST calls
- **Helper pattern**: `withCanvasClient` for connection reuse
- **Canvas selection**: `--canvas` flag (default: "default")
- **Better errors**: Connection guidance when server is down

### 5. Current Status (Updated June 2025)
- **Working**: 
  - All Canvas operations via gRPC (load, use, info, etc.)
  - ExecuteTrace RPC for single execution debugging
  - Traffic generation with SimpleEval integration
  - Virtual time tracking for deterministic simulations
  - Batched execution for high-rate generators (1000+ RPS)
  - MetricStore architecture with RingBufferStore
  - Asynchronous metric processing with MetricTracer
- **Completed Recent Work**:
  - Generator lifecycle management (start/stop/pause/resume)
  - MetricStore interface with pluggable backends
  - Memory-efficient metrics with circular buffers
  - Standard aggregations (count, sum, avg, min, max, percentiles)
- **TODO**: 
  - Human-readable trace command output
  - Batch generator operations (StartAllGenerators, StopAllGenerators)
  - Dashboard integration with new gRPC endpoints
  - Server-streaming for real-time metrics

## Traffic Generation & MetricStore Architecture (June 2025)
When working with traffic generation and metrics:
- **Generator Pattern**: Simple ticker for <100 RPS, batched execution for higher rates
- **Virtual Time**: Each generator maintains consistent virtual clock (1/rate seconds per event)
- **MetricStore Interface**: Clean abstraction with WritePoint/WriteBatch/Query/Aggregate
- **RingBufferStore**: Default implementation with configurable retention (e.g., 1 hour)
- **Async Processing**: MetricTracer writes to store in 100ms batches
- **Testing**: Use `go test -v ./console -run TestGenerator` for generator tests

## FlowEval Runtime Migration (June 2025)
When continuing work on FlowEval, note that we're in the middle of migrating from string-based to runtime-based flow analysis:
- **New code location**: runtime/flowrteval.go (runtime-based) replacing runtime/floweval.go (string-based)
- **Key types**: RateMap (runtime/ratemap.go), FlowScope (runtime/flowscope.go), GeneratorEntryPointRuntime
- **Architecture**: Uses actual ComponentInstance objects from SimpleEval, no duplicate instances
- **Pattern**: NWBase wrapper provides smart defaults for non-flow-analyzable components
- **Status**: Steps 1-7 complete, need to finish migration (steps 8-9) and update Canvas integration
- **Test with**: `go test -v ./runtime -run "TestFlowEvalRuntime|TestSolveSystemFlowsRuntime"`

## Metrics Architecture (June 2025)
Important: Metrics are pre-aggregated at collection time, not query time:
- **MetricSpec**: Defines aggregation type (p95, avg, sum) and window size at metric creation
- **MetricTracer**: Processes events and calculates aggregations based on spec during collection
- **MetricStore**: Stores pre-aggregated values, not raw events
- **Query API**: Returns pre-aggregated data points directly (no query-time aggregation)
- **Bug Fix**: When removing metrics, use `delete(map, key)` not `map[key] = nil` to avoid panics
- **Testing**: Run `./test_metrics_e2e.sh` for comprehensive end-to-end validation   

Also be conservative on how many comments are you are adding or modifying unless it is absolutely necessary (for example a comment could be contradicting what is going on - in which case it is prudent to modify it).  
When modifying files just focus on areas where the change is required instead of diving into a full fledged refactor.
Make sure you ignore 'gen' and 'node_modules' as it has a lot of files you wont need for most things and are either auto generated or just package dependencies
When updating .md files and in commit messages use emojis and flowerly languages sparingly.  We dont want to be too grandios or overpromising.
Make sure the playwright tool is setup so you can inspect the browser when we are implementing and testing the Dashboard features.
Do not refer to claude or anthropic in your commit messages
Do not rebuild the server - it will be continuosly be rebuilt and run by the air configs.  Output of the server will be written to /tmp/sdlserver.log.  Build errors will also be shown in this log file.
Find the root cause of an issue before figuring out a solution.  Fix problems.
Do not create workarounds for issues without asking.  Always find the root cause of an issue and fix it.
The web module automatically builds when files are changed - DO NOT run npm build or npm run build commands.
Proto files are automatically regenerated when changed - DO NOT run buf generate commands.

## Available commands

When generating protos run the command `buf generate`

To build the SDL binary use `make`.  The binary is now already in path and can be run with `sdl`
