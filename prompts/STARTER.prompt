I am continuing with a previous project.  Here are the files and summaries.   Understand it and give me a recap so we can continue where we left off.   
Remember as we are building features if you have to modify or create files only use the tools provided instead of generating entire files in your response.  
When updating an existing file always call the read_file tool first to get its latest state.  Please limit changes that are just modifying variable names or comment text unless absolutely necessary.  
Also be conservative on how many comments are you are adding or modifying unless it is absolutely necessary (for example a comment could be contradicting what is going on - in which case it is prudent to modify it).  
When modifying files just focus on areas where the change is required instead of diving into a full fledged refactor.
