# SDL Conference Workshop Development Status
# "Building an Open Source System Design Interview Coach With Interactive Simulations"

## üéØ CONFERENCE VISION

As a former FAANG engineering leader who's interviewed 100s of candidates, building tools for system design interview preparation featuring:

* Interactive simulators showing how architectures perform under load
* Visual tools demonstrating distributed systems concepts (CAP theorem, consistency models)  
* Performance comparison tools for evaluating architectural trade-offs
* Failure scenario simulators revealing resilience thinking

**Core Concept**: "Incredible Machine" style creation and testing of systems with live metrics like latencies, capacities, call counts, errors, etc.

## üìÅ CURRENT STATE - WHAT WE HAVE

### ‚úÖ READY FOR DEMO:
- [x] Core SDL language and runtime
- [x] Canvas API with parameter modification (Set, Run, Plot)
- [x] Capacity modeling with ResourcePool (M/M/c queuing)
- [x] Multiple visualization formats (latency plots, diagrams, histograms)
- [x] CLI commands (run, plot, diagram, validate)
- [x] Netflix streaming service demo scenario (examples/netflix/)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite validating workshop scenarios

### üöß PARTIALLY READY:
- [ ] Recipe-based workflows (engine exists, need `sdl execute` command)
- [ ] Component library (good foundation, needs more realistic components)
- [ ] Documentation (comprehensive but needs workshop-specific content)

### ‚ùå MISSING FOR CONFERENCE:
- [ ] Real-time dashboard interface
- [ ] FAANG-style interview scenario library
- [ ] Workshop-specific CLI commands
- [ ] Live multi-panel visualization
- [ ] Automated scenario progression

## üìã TODO LIST

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY (Essential for Conference)

1. **[PENDING]** Test current Netflix scenario with existing Canvas API
   - Run comprehensive test suite to validate current capabilities
   - Identify any gaps or issues in the Canvas API
   - Ensure all parameter modifications work correctly
   - Status: Ready to test examples/netflix/traffic_spike_demo_test.go

2. **[PENDING]** Implement 'sdl execute' command for recipe runner
   - Build command parser for recipe files
   - Enable scripted demo workflows
   - Critical for smooth conference presentation
   - Location: cmd/sdl/commands/execute.go

3. **[PENDING]** Create 'sdl dashboard' command for live multi-panel view
   - Multi-panel terminal interface showing real-time updates
   - Display latency plots, system diagrams, utilization metrics
   - The "Incredible Machine" style visualization
   - Location: cmd/sdl/commands/dashboard.go

4. **[PENDING]** Fix any Canvas API gaps discovered by Netflix test
   - Address issues found during testing
   - Ensure robust parameter modification
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

### üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for Conference)

5. **[PENDING]** Add realistic components (CDN, LoadBalancer, MessageQueue, etc.)
   - Expand component library beyond current set
   - More authentic distributed system modeling
   - Location: components/ and components/decl/

6. **[PENDING]** Build additional FAANG interview scenarios (Uber, Instagram, WhatsApp)
   - Create more diverse workshop content
   - Cover different architectural patterns
   - Location: examples/uber/, examples/instagram/, examples/whatsapp/

7. **[PENDING]** Create workshop-specific commands (sdl workshop, scenario management)
   - Specialized CLI for workshop flow
   - Scenario loading and management
   - Location: cmd/sdl/commands/workshop.go

8. **[PENDING]** Add system utilization plots, throughput charts, failure rate graphs
   - Enhanced visualization beyond latency plots
   - More comprehensive performance analysis
   - Location: viz/ package enhancements

### üìÖ LOW PRIORITY (Post-Conference)

9. **[PENDING]** Build automated scenario progression with guided steps
   - Automated workshop guidance
   - Step-by-step progression

10. **[PENDING]** Implement live parameter sliders/modification interface
    - Interactive parameter controls
    - Real-time manipulation during demos

11. **[PENDING]** Create browser-based prototype for post-conference development
    - Full "Incredible Machine" style web UI
    - Drag-and-drop system building

## üé™ DEMO SCENARIO - NETFLIX TRAFFIC SPIKE

**Files Created:**
- `examples/netflix/netflix.sdl` - Complete streaming service model
- `examples/netflix/traffic_spike_demo_test.go` - Canvas-based test suite

**Demo Flow Validated:**
1. **Baseline Performance** ‚Üí Normal traffic conditions
2. **Traffic Spike** ‚Üí 4x load increase (Stranger Things premiere)
3. **Cache Optimization** ‚Üí Improve hit rate from 85% to 95%
4. **Capacity Scaling** ‚Üí Double CDN capacity
5. **Database Bottleneck** ‚Üí Identify database as constraint
6. **Encoding Workload** ‚Üí Video upload pipeline testing
7. **Failure Scenarios** ‚Üí CDN capacity limits
8. **Edge Cases** ‚Üí Zero capacity, infinite load, perfect system

**Workshop Narrative:**
- Candidate: "We'll just add more servers"
- Demo: Show how database becomes bottleneck
- SDL shows: 95th percentile latency explodes even with infinite app servers

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

**Current SDL Components:**
- `parser/` - SDL text to AST conversion
- `loader/` - Import resolution and type checking  
- `runtime/` - Simulation execution engine
- `components/` - System component library (disk, cache, etc.)
- `console/` - Interactive analysis engine (Canvas API)
- `viz/` - Plotting and diagram generation
- `cmd/sdl/` - Command-line interface

**Canvas API (Ready):**
```go
canvas.Load("scenarios/netflix.sdl")
canvas.Use("NetflixSystem") 
canvas.Set("videoService.cdn.pool.ArrivalRate", 200.0)  // Traffic spike
canvas.Run("spike", "videoService.StreamVideo", 1000)
canvas.Plot([]string{"baseline", "spike"}, "comparison")
```
