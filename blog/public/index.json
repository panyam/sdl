[{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"Systems read, transform and write data between components in the pursuit of business goals. Sounds simple! The choice of components however affect the overall cost of a system across a number of metrics. These metrics could be span performance (eg latencies, throughputs), health (error rates and availability), or even costs (plain $$s). Understanding the performance characteristics of the system (and its components) is thus paramount.\nSystem's work-centers A system (eg a VM) or its components spend time in two essential activities:\n I/O - Reading or writing data from/between media. This could be media such disks, memory, or even to remote systems across a network. Note that the \u0026quot;network\u0026quot; is not treated as a special case. The \u0026quot;network\u0026quot; is just another medium for communicating with other systems. The cost of I/O across a network is part of the overall cost of a system. Processing - This is the time/span spent by a system/component transforming data in-between I/O activities.  Machine/VM Provisioning Costs Since ultimately physical or (virtual) machines are the ones powering services, the costs associated with the storage, memory and processing power of these machines is important to understand.\nMachines can be hosted (in a data-center) or now more popularly within a cloud provider's offering. The provisioning costs can be modelled as below.\nData-Center costs When self-hosting in a data-center servers are hosted in Racks. The unit of space in a rack is the Rack-Unit and data-center servers (or their enclosures) are built to ensure they fit in multiples of rack units. Enterprise-grade servers are typically built with higher reliability and are typically beefier machines. Some of the costs are below. Note that while storage is usually replaceable memory and processing are usually coupled. Typically higher memory machines have larger number of cores.\n   Item Cost notes     Cost of a Rack $45 per Rack Unit per month    Enterprise HDD $515 for 10Tb 0.08c per Gb per month over 5 years   Enterprise SSD $4300 for 7.8Tb 0.1c per GB per month over 5 years   Memory $1600 for 32Gb Dell Server 0.1c per Gb per hour (over 5 years)    Cloud costs Leveraging the cloud is almost a no-brainer for most businesses mainly due to a lack of core competency (in managing infrastructure) as well as in leveraging economies of scale and scope. The cloud has matured to offer extremely high level of customizability while still ensuring elasticity and avoiding high fixed costs.\nCost of Storage    Item Cost Notes     HDD $0.025 per GB per month    SSD $0.1 per GB per month    Memory $0.01 per 1GB (RAM) per hour = $7.2 per month Typically this would depend on the cores but as the memory increases so do number of cores. The beefy m5n.24xlarge instance for example has 96 cores with 384Gb of RAM costing: $5.712 per hour = $4100 per month.    Cost of processing Processing data is not free. It requires CPUs (or GPUs). Processing costs are influenced by the number of cores in a machine (which determines the level of parallelism). Very often, the number of cores is not completely independent of the amount of memory in a machine. So the above table has a rough rule-of-thumb on calculating Memory+Processing together. However in the sytem design exercises and case stadies that follow differnet machine classes (by different cloud vendors) will be considered to play with the costs and performance of a system.\nData Transfer (I/O) latencies Data transfer occurs at several levels, between several types of media and across several links (connections). From Peter Norvigâ€™s famous table of costs:\n   Operation Time   L1 cache reference 0.5 ns   Branch mispredicgt 5 ns   L2 Cache Reference 7 ns   Mutex lock/unlock 25 ns   Main memory reference 100 ns   Compressing 1k with zippy 3000 ns   Send 1k over a 1GBps network 10,000 ns (10 us)   Read 4k randomly from SSD (1GBps) 150,000 ns (150 us)   Read 1MB sequentially from RAM 250000 ns (250 us)   Round trip with a datacenter 5000000 ns (500 us)   Read 1MB sequentially from SSD 1000000 ns (1ms)   (HDD) Disk Seek 10,000,000 ns (10ms)   Read 1MB Sequentially from HDD 20,000,000 ns (20ms)   Send a packet from CA -\u0026gt; Netherlands -\u0026gt; CA 150,000,000 (150ms)    Also see a Humanized Comparison!!\nKey Takeaways The costs discussed here are at a very basic (almost existential) level in a system's lifecycle. However systems are complex - especially when the system is not trivial and can composed of several sub systems. To model the cost of a system there is a need to model the systems enclosed by the parent system. The costs highlighted allow the system to progressively model costs of systems with increasing complexity.\n","link":"https://leetcoach.com/post/modelling-costs/","section":"post","tags":["markdown","text"],"title":"Basic Cost Estimation"},{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/tags/markdown/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"markdown"},{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/tags/text/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"text"},{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://leetcoach.com/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.\nIn this example we will be using KaTeX\n Create a partial under /layouts/partials/math.html Within this partial reference the Auto-render Extension or host these scripts locally.
