# SDL Console History and Auto-suggest Improvements

## New Features

### 1. **Persistent Command History**
- Commands are automatically saved to `~/.sdl_history`
- History persists across console restarts
- Up to 1000 commands are preserved
- Duplicates of consecutive commands are avoided

### 2. **Fixed Auto-suggest Dropdown**
- No longer shows suggestions automatically when empty
- Only shows suggestions when you have typed something
- Press Tab to see completions
- Less intrusive interface

## Testing the Features

### Test Persistent History
```bash
# First session
./sdl console --port 8080
SDL> load examples/contacts/contacts.sdl
SDL> use ContactsSystem
SDL> set server.pool.ArrivalRate 15
SDL> !git status
SDL> exit

# Second session (restart)
./sdl console --port 8080
SDL> â†‘  # Should show "!git status"
SDL> â†‘  # Should show "set server.pool.ArrivalRate 15"
SDL> â†‘  # Should show "use ContactsSystem"
SDL> â†‘  # Should show "load examples/contacts/contacts.sdl"
```

### Test Fixed Auto-suggest
```bash
SDL>        # Empty prompt - no suggestions shown automatically
SDL> l      # Type 'l' - suggestions appear
SDL> <TAB>  # Explicit tab shows completions
SDL> load   # Type command - no auto-suggestions until tab
SDL> load <TAB>  # Shows file completions
```

### Test History File
```bash
# Check the history file
cat ~/.sdl_history

# Should contain commands from previous sessions
load examples/contacts/contacts.sdl
use ContactsSystem
set server.pool.ArrivalRate 15
!git status
```

## Expected Behavior

### Startup
```
ðŸš€ SDL Console starting...
ðŸ“Š Dashboard: http://localhost:8080
ðŸ“¡ WebSocket: ws://localhost:8080/api/live
ðŸ’¬ Type 'help' for available commands, Ctrl+D to quit

ðŸ“š Command history loaded from: /Users/username/.sdl_history (4 commands)

SDL> 
```

### Exit (Ctrl+C)
```
^C

ðŸ‘‹ Saving history and exiting...
ðŸ“š Command history saved to: /Users/username/.sdl_history (8 commands)
```

### Exit (Normal)
```
SDL> exit
ðŸ‘‹ Goodbye!
ðŸ“š Command history saved to: /Users/username/.sdl_history (8 commands)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: No intrusive auto-suggest dropdown
2. **Productivity**: Command history across sessions saves time
3. **Reliability**: History saved on both normal exit and Ctrl+C
4. **Smart**: Avoids duplicate consecutive commands
5. **Manageable**: Limited to 1000 commands to avoid bloat

## Implementation Details

- History file: `~/.sdl_history` (falls back to `./.sdl_history` if home dir unavailable)
- Signal handling: Saves history on SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM
- Deduplication: Consecutive identical commands are not added to history
- Limit: Only last 1000 commands are preserved to keep file manageable
- Auto-suggest: Only shows when there's actual input to complete
