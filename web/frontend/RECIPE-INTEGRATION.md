# Recipe Integration in SDL Dashboard

## Overview
Successfully integrated recipe execution controls directly into the tabbed editor, eliminating the need for a separate Recipe Runner panel. Recipe files (.recipe) now have inline controls within the editor for step-by-step execution.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tabbed Editor Enhancement (tabbed-editor.ts)
- Added recipe-specific properties to FileTab interface:
  - `isRecipe`: Boolean to identify recipe files
  - `isRunning`: Current execution state
  - `currentLine`: Line number being executed
  - `decorations`: Monaco editor decorations for line highlighting
- Added recipe toolbar that appears for .recipe files with Run/Step/Stop/Restart controls
- Implemented line highlighting for the currently executing command
- Added execution indicator (▶) to tab titles when recipe is running
- Created `setRecipeRunning()` method to update execution state and line highlighting

### 2. Dashboard Integration (dashboard.ts)
- Removed Recipe Runner panel from default layout
- Removed "Run Recipe" button from main toolbar
- Connected recipe action handler in `createCodeEditorComponent()`:
  - Creates RecipeRunner instance on-demand
  - Connects output to console panel
  - Updates editor line highlighting based on execution state
  - Maps recipe actions (run/stop/step/restart) to RecipeRunner methods

### 3. Recipe Runner (recipe-runner.ts)
- Existing RecipeRunner class used without modification
- Parses .recipe files and executes SDL commands
- Provides state updates including current line number
- Outputs execution results to console

### 4. CSS Styling (tabbed-editor.css)
- Added recipe toolbar styles
- Created button styles for Run (primary), Stop (danger), and regular controls
- Added line highlighting styles for current execution line

## User Experience

### Opening a Recipe File
1. User selects a .recipe file from the file explorer
2. File opens in a new tab (or switches to existing tab)
3. Recipe toolbar appears below the tab bar showing Run button

### Running a Recipe
1. User clicks Run button in recipe toolbar
2. Recipe starts in step mode
3. Current line is highlighted in blue with a left border
4. Tab title shows ▶ indicator
5. Toolbar updates to show Step/Stop/Restart buttons
6. Output appears in console panel

### Stepping Through
1. User clicks Step button to execute current command
2. Line highlighting moves to next executable line
3. Console shows command output
4. Process continues until recipe completes or user stops

### Visual Indicators
- **Tab Title**: Shows ▶ when recipe is running
- **Current Line**: Blue background with left border
- **Toolbar**: Context-sensitive buttons based on execution state
- **Console**: Real-time output of recipe execution

## Benefits
1. **Integrated Experience**: No need to switch between panels
2. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of execution progress
3. **Familiar Controls**: Similar to debugger interfaces
4. **Efficient Space Usage**: No additional panel required
5. **Context Preservation**: Recipe source and execution state in same view

## Testing
Created test recipe at `/examples/test-integration.recipe` with basic SDL commands for testing the integration.

## Future Enhancements
1. Add breakpoint support
2. Variable inspection during execution
3. Recipe execution history
4. Auto-run on file save option
5. Execution speed controls for auto mode
