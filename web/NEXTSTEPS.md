# SDL Web Dashboard - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed

### Dashboard Layout Unification (v3.0)
- **Unified Layout**: Single dashboard implementation for both server and WASM modes
- **FileClient Interface**: Abstraction layer for file operations across modes
- **Multi-Filesystem Explorer**: Support for multiple mounted filesystems with visual indicators
- **Tabbed Editor**: Multiple file editing with modification tracking
- **Real File Operations**: Server-side file listing, reading, writing (partial implementation)

### DockView v2.0 Migration

### Major UI Upgrade
- **Migrated from GoldenLayout to DockView** - Modern, actively maintained library with better TypeScript support
- **Professional Layout System** - 4-panel dockable interface with drag-and-drop reorganization
- **Layout Persistence** - Custom panel arrangements automatically saved to localStorage and restored on page reload
- **Enhanced Styling** - Dark theme with proper contrast, visible splitters, and clear tab states

### System Visualization Improvements
- **Replaced manual SVG with Graphviz/dot** - Automatic layout engine eliminates positioning issues
- **Per-method traffic display** - Shows individual traffic values for each component method instead of single component value
- **Clean dot file generation** - Proper clusters, styling, and method node organization

### Technical Improvements
- **Modern Dependencies** - Updated to DockView for better maintenance and features
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for layout restoration failures
- **Performance** - Efficient layout updates and WebSocket content refresh

## üéØ Current State

### Functional Features
- ‚úÖ **4 Dockable Panels**: System Architecture, Traffic Generation, Measurements, Live Metrics
- ‚úÖ **Resizable Splitters**: 8px wide, clearly visible with hover effects
- ‚úÖ **Layout Persistence**: Automatic save/restore of custom arrangements
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates without layout recreation
- ‚úÖ **Graphviz Rendering**: Clean system diagrams with per-method traffic
- ‚úÖ **Reset Functionality**: One-click return to default layout

### Panel Functionality
- ‚úÖ **System Architecture**: Displays system topology with Graphviz rendering
- ‚úÖ **Traffic Generation**: Generator controls (currently shows empty state)
- ‚úÖ **Measurements**: Measurement configuration (currently shows empty state)
- ‚úÖ **Live Metrics**: Dynamic charts grid (currently shows empty state)

## üöß In Progress

### FileSystem Architecture Refactoring
- **Current Issue**: Mismatch between filesystem mount paths and actual file paths from server
- **Solution**: Implement FileSystemClient interface with concrete implementations
- **Benefits**: 
  - Server controls exposed folders for security
  - Client doesn't know actual server paths
  - Consistent interface for all filesystem types
  - Easy to add new filesystem types (IndexedDB, S3, etc.)

### Implementation Plan:
1. **FileSystemClient Interface**: Base interface for all filesystem operations
2. **LocalFileSystemClient**: For server-hosted file systems with HTTP REST API
3. **GitHubFileSystemClient**: For read-only GitHub repositories
4. **Server Handler**: `/filesystems/{fsId}/{path}` endpoint with security checks
5. **MultiFSExplorer Update**: Use FileSystemClient instances instead of type checking

## üîÑ Next Development Priorities

### 1. Complete FileSystem Architecture (Immediate)
- Implement FileSystemClient interface and concrete classes
- Create server-side filesystem handler with security
- Update MultiFSExplorer to use new clients
- Test file operations end-to-end

### 2. Data Integration (High Priority)
- **Load SDL Files**: Connect file loading functionality to populate System Architecture panel
- **Generator Integration**: Wire up traffic generation controls with backend API
- **Measurement System**: Enable measurement creation and configuration
- **Live Data Flow**: Connect real-time metrics to charts

### 2. Enhanced Visualization (Medium Priority)
- **Interactive System Diagrams**: Click to select/highlight components
- **Traffic Flow Animation**: Visual representation of data flow between components
- **Component Details**: Hover tooltips with component information
- **Method-level Metrics**: Drill-down views for individual component methods

### 3. User Experience Improvements (Medium Priority)
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations
- **Error Feedback**: User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick actions for common operations
- **Tour/Help System**: Guided introduction for new users

### 4. Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- **Layout Templates**: Predefined layouts for different use cases
- **Panel Maximization**: Full-screen mode for individual panels
- **Export Functionality**: Save diagrams and charts as images
- **Collaborative Features**: Multi-user layout sharing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

### DockView Integration
- **Component Factory**: Clean pattern for creating panel content
- **Event Handling**: Proper separation of layout events from content updates
- **Persistence Layer**: localStorage-based with fallback error handling
- **Styling System**: CSS overrides for dark theme integration

### Code Organization
- **Modular Structure**: Separate methods for default layout and restoration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for DockView API
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of layout corruption
- **Performance**: Efficient updates and memory management

### Technical Debt
- **Minimal**: Clean migration with proper cleanup of old GoldenLayout code
- **Documentation**: Updated SUMMARY.md reflects current architecture
- **Testing**: Existing Playwright tests still valid for layout verification

## üöÄ Deployment Status

### Ready for Production
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Clean npm run build with no errors
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: All packages properly installed and configured
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compilation without warnings
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and runtime efficiency

### Testing Status
- ‚úÖ **Manual Testing**: All panel operations working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Layout Persistence**: Save/restore functionality verified
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Proper behavior across different screen sizes
- üîÑ **Automated Tests**: May need updates for DockView-specific interactions
