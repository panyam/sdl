Basic Reusable Components
-------------------------
* ID Generator
* TinyURL
* Combine these to form a key-value store
* Distributed counters (key/count pairs - uneven key distributions, high increment qps - eg 200k qps - eg like counts etc)
  - Can be *only* counts - or events written that need to be summarized - eg as sharded counters (sharded event processors - microbatch)
